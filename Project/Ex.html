                <h1>Sustainable travel doesn’t mean sacrificing luxury</h1>
            </li>
            </br>
            <p style="color: azure; font-variant-caps: small-caps;">
                Twenty years or so ago, the words luxury and sustainable were rarely side by side. Expensive taste was more likely to be big and brash than purpose-driven and environmentally sensitive. Travel was no exception, and there were no limits to what money (and
                a large carbon footprint) could buy. As we dive into a new decade, things are quite different. While a bling-heavy breed of luxury travel still exists, there is a rising tide of the more thoughtful. In an age where most stuff is available
                at the click of a button, luxury is less about "things" and more about experiences. It’s about careful craftsmanship, unique cultures, untamed landscapes, and going slow. The shift is timely; amid the climate crisis, it’s more important
                than ever to make travel count. Whether funding vital conservation efforts or uplifting communities, luxury travellers can do their bit without compromising a jot of fun. After all, any experience built upon a genuine love for a place,
                landscape, or community, will always surpass those that don’t.</p>

                High-end, low-impact accommodation </h1>
            <p style="color: white; font-variant-caps: small-caps;">
                </br> Luxury accommodations have a significant advantage when it comes to sustainability: exclusivity. Generally speaking, where there are fewer people, there is less toll on the environment. A case in point is Costa Rica’s upscale lodges. On
                the Península de Osa, where old-growth rainforest tumbles down into the wild Pacific, Lapa Rios’ 1000-acre nature reserve hosts just 30 guests at a time – howler monkeys pop by for breakfast, and scarlet macaws fly overhead. Over on the
                Caribbean coast, the owners of Kasiiya Papagayo is building low-impact bungalows so slowly that nature has time to grow around them. Both pristine landscapes would be at risk from exploitation if not for the financial support of conscious
                travellers. </p>

            <!-- <img src="scotland.jpg" alt="scotland"> -->

            <p style="color:black; font-variant-caps: small-caps;">Meander through ancient olive groves on the Greek island of Ios, and you are most likely enjoying the conservation efforts of the exclusive Calilo Resort – having bought a quarter of the island, its owners will only develop 1% of it. And,
                in Scotland, the Wildland portfolio of carefully-restored properties supports rewilding efforts across over 200,000-acres of mountains, streams, peat bogs, and forests.


                <br> Grandiose conservation projects aren’t the only way for luxury accommodations to be sustainable. Green energy and sustainable design is a financial investment, so high-end properties are well placed to take the plunge. Bucuti & Tara
                Beach Resort is one of the Caribbean’s most sought-after hotels overlooking Aruba’s prized palm-fringed sands. It’s also the greenest; 618 solar panels, in-room energy-saving measures, and an ozone-based laundry system has helped it achieve
                carbon neutrality. City-slickers can get in on the act, too. Over in Denmark, Villa Copenhagen’s Earth Suite is made from entirely recycled materials. In Germany, Aqua Hotel is the world’s first high-rise passive house – with energy coming
                entirely from renewable sources. Five ITC Hotels across India are powered 100% by renewable energy, as is Inspira Santa Marta in Lisbon.
